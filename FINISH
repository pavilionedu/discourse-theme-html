#
# exercise:     1. If I wanted links in my forum footer for SEO purposes where
#                  would I put them in a theme?
#
#               2. If I wanted to add a "notice" in the top section of my forum 
#                  using a theme what would I use?
#
#               3. Explain what an Ember Component is and give two examples in
#                  the ``discourse/discourse`` code.
